# Contributing to the Generator
First of all, thank you for deciding to help out! There are a couple ways you can help, starting with the easiest to the hardest.

## Before you Begin
Make sure you looked over the community guidlines before starting. These guidelines also apply to facts, so if you see a fact that breaks those guidlines, open up an issue or delete it yourself.

## Adding (and/or removing) Facts
This is the easiest portion of this. If you have only 1 or 2 facts that you want to add, open up an issue and someone will take care of it. If you want to import a bunch of facts, make a fork of this and go to town. When you're finished, open up a pull request. Simple as that!

In the case of removing facts, you can, as mentioned earlier, open up an issue. Or, if you're in the middle of adding a bunch of facts, just remove it yourself.

(Note: If you don't understand the formatting used to add facts, you can put them in a .txt file and commit it. It'll all get added.)

Also, if you spot a duplicate fact/typo/fake fact, fix it via issue/pull request.

## HTML Cleanup
Do you know CSS or think the HTML code can be cleaned up? Fork and edit to your hearts content and, when you think it's ready, open up a pull request. If everything looks fine, it'll be accepted.

## Hosting
This may seem a bit out of the ordinary, but if you want to host this generator, go ahead. Just make sure to keep it up-to-date and let us know via an issue/pull request.

## Crediting
All credits, will be added to the wiki. That means what users helped in what ways and where the facts were originally located.
